## Topic Recapitulation

- analysis of parallel programs running under relaxed memory models
  - effects of cache, out-of-order execution
  * depends on architecture

    . . .

    *   **Intel `x86`: store buffering**
    *   ARM/POWER: almost arbitrary reordering of loads and stores

. . .

- this is significantly harder then analysis of all interleavings of the program

. . .

- we approach this by encoding the memory model into the program

## Current Status: Relaxed Memory

rather efficient implementation of `x86`-TSO

- evaluation on nonsymbolic SV-COMP concurrency benchmarks
(54 in total)
- compared with CBMC and Nidhugg

        TSO errors              &  3   & 10     &  3 \\
        uniqly solved           &  5   &  6     &  8 \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \end{latex}

. . .

- future: integrate some ideas from stateless model checking
  - memory action graphs
  - more advanced exploration algorithms

## Current Status: SV-COMP 2019

- DIVINE can now once more run (non-preprocessed) SV-COMP benchmarks
- preprocessing -- it is still not clear what is the future
- tested mostly on concurrency
- more results expended after summer

    - symbolic version not yet tested by me

## What Next?

- publication about `x86`-TSO (in progress)

\bigskip

- SV-COMP 2019

\bigskip

- more efficient relaxed memory model verification
