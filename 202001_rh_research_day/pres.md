abstract: |
    DIVINE is a tool for analysis of programs written in C and C++ that
    primarily targets hard to find bugs, including concurrency-related bugs,
    assertion violations, and memory errors. It is developed in the Parallel and
    Distributed Systems Laboratory at the Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk
    University. One of the main strengths of DIVINE is that it is precise and
    can discover bugs which are hard or impossible to find by other means.
    Unsurprisingly, this precision comes at some cost in the human and computing
    effort put to the analysis. In this presentation, we outline some of the
    strengths and weaknesses of DIVINE. We describe how we can use DIVINE for
    the analysis of programs which have source code and tests available, and
    what can we do if that is not the case. We also show how DIVINE can be used
    with programs that run in the POSIX environment, i.e., use system calls and
    interact with other programs using filesystem or network. Finally, we
    present how we can apply DIVINE to the discovery of sporadically occurring
    concurrency bugs.

## DIVINE's Abilities

- DIVINE executes the program in a controlled environment
  - needs sources of the complete program + test cases \pause
  - this includes libraries the program uses \pause
  - if the program communicates with environment, the environment has to be
    handled somehow

. . .

- DIVINE can discover bugs which are hard to find by other means
  - access out of stack variable boundaries \pause
  - concurrency bugs
    - data races
    - relaxed memory
    - nontermination (deadlocks, livelocks) \pause
  - behaviour can depend on input values which are assumed to be arbitrary

-->

## Before Verification I

1.  obtain source code of the program to be verified \pause
  - including dependencies (except for the basics -- C and C++ standard
    libraries) \pause
  - must be buildable by clang \pause
  - no assembly components or inline assembly

## Before Verification II

2.  obtain tests
  - ideally, the program comes with unit tests usable for verification \pause
  - not all tests work (concurrency stress tests, tests dependent on timing)
    \pause
  - it is often easier to write concurrency tests for DIVINE than "normal"
    concurrency tests \pause
  - concurrency tests in DIVINE are \emph{deterministic} -- they cannot
    sometimes fail and sometimes succeed \pause
  - new tests might be needed

## Verification & After

- verification can be resource intensive
  - due to parallelism
  - due to inputs/unspecified values

. . .

- if an error is found, it can be analysed using an interactive simulator
  - a debugger-like tool integrated in DIVINE

## Execution Environment

many programs communicate with other programs using file system or network

- DIVINE has support for many POSIX APIs

- can be simulated/modelled (arbitrary input, mock clients/servers)
- or captured and replayed
  1. run the program in a way it can communicate and capture it
  2. use the capture in verification
  - only works if the program does not encounter need for further communication
    during verification run
- capture + replay can also make debugging these programs easier
  - using our interactive simulator
