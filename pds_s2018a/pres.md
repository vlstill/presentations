## Verification of Parallel Programs I

- design of parallel programs is hard
- easy to make mistakes -- data races, deadlocks

  . . .

- **memory behaviour is very complex**

  - effects of caches, out-of-order and speculative execution

  . . .

```{.cpp}
int x, y = 0;
void thread0() {
    y = 1;
    int a = x;
}

void thread1() {
    x = 1;
    int b = y;
}
```

- is it possible to end with `a == 0 && b == 0`? \pause{} **yes**

##  Verification of Parallel Programs II

- we focus on C and C++

  . . .

- program is translated into LLVM intermediate language

- LLVM is executed by the model checker

- exploration of all possible runs of the program

  . . .

- detect assertions, memory errors, compiler traps, …

## Relaxed Memory Example

```{.cpp}
int x, y = 0;
void thread0() {              void thread1() {
    y = 1;                        x = 1;
    int a = x;                    int b = y;
}                                 int c = x;
                              }

```

## Why Relaxed Memory?

- memory is significantly slower than processor cores
- processor has caches to speed up execution

  . . .

- optimizations of cache coherency protocols\
  $\rightarrow$ observable effects

  . . .

- reordering of instructions might be also observable

  . . .

- overall behaviour described by a **(relaxed) memory model**

## Memory-Model-Aware Analysis -- My Approach I

- encode the memory model into the program
- verify it using a verifier without memory model support
  - e.g. DIVINE, a lot of other verifiers
  - program transformation instead of modification of the verifier

. . .

```{.cpp}
x = 1;
int a = y;
```

$\rightsquigarrow$

```{.cpp}
_store( &x, 1 );
int a = _load( &y );
```

- `_load`, `_store` simulate the memory model

## Memory-Model-Aware Analysis -- My Approach II

**program transformation**

- can be improved with static analysis
- memory model independent

. . .

**memory operations**

- memory model dependent
- rather complex
- impact efficiency a lot $\rightarrow$ the main aim of my work
  - efficient data structures (time & memory)
  - amount of nondeterminism
- I will primarily use bounded reordering of instructions
