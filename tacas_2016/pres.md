## DIVINE: an Overview

*   verification of real-world parallel C++ code

\iffalse
\fi

\bigskip

*   safety and LTL properties

\bigskip

*   powerfull reduction techniques

## Verification of Real-World Parallel C++ Code

*   explicit-state model checking
*   using LLVM as an itermediate language
*   standard C, C++, and `pthread` libraries nearly completely supported
*   exact verification, no bounding, all meaningful interleavings
*   support all language features (including exceptions)
*   no symbolic data support (yet)

## Verification Properties

*   assertion safety
*   memory safety
*   memory leaks
*   mutex safety
*   uninitialized memory use
*   LTL
*   gives counterexample if property does not hold

## Powerfull Reduction Techniques

*   state space size reduction ($\tau+$ reduction)
    *   ommision of uninteresting interleavings
*   memory footprint reduction (lossless compression)
*   parallel and distributed search

## DIVINE: Summarization

*   a powerfull explicit-state model checker for real-world C++
*   C++ library support and full C++ language features support
*   specializes on parallel programs
*   verifies large scale of properties
*   got 951 points out of 1240 in concurrecy category
