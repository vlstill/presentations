\begin{abstract}
    Automatic testing of programming assignments is highly desirable as it can
    provide fast feedback for the students and allows the teachers to teach
    efficiently even in courses with many students.
    However, writing tests for students' solutions can be tedious.
    In this work, we present a novel approach to test generation for small Haskell
    assignments.
    Such assignments usually consist of one function (with possibility to use
    helper functions in its definition) that the students are supposed to program
    according to a teacher's specification.
    The teacher is not required to write tests for this function.
    Instead, we make use of an example solution, which the teacher should have
    anyway to assess difficulty of the assignment.
    Using the example solution, and (if needed) a specification of input values for
    the function, our tools is able to automatically generate randomized tests.
    If these tests fail, the student is presented with a counterexample which
    shows the input values, the expected output of the tested function and the
    output computed by their solution.
    % In this work, we present a tool which simplifies testing small programming
    % assignments written in the Haskell functional programming language.
    % We test these exercises at the level of functions -- given a solution to
    % the assignment (a function) and (if needed) specification of the input data
    % for the tested function, the tools can automatically derive tests, compare
    % the teacher's solution to the student's solution, and report the result.

\section{Testing Capabilities}

Our tools \hsExprTest{} is based on QuickCheck~\cite{Koen2000}, a Haskell tool for
specification-based testing of Haskell programs.
It uses QuickCheck for automatic generation of test inputs, and to shrink test
inputs, which allows us to produce small counterexamples.
It also uses QuickCheck's ability to generate printable and shrinkable
functions~\cite{Koen2012}, which is used when testing implementations of
higher-order functions (i.e., functions which take functions as arguments, for
example a \texttt{map} function, which takes a function and applies it to each
element of a list, producing a list of results).

However, unlike QuickCheck, \hsExprTest{} uses the teacher's solution as a
specification and automatically derives a test expression which compares the
teacher's and student's solution.
This expression generation is driven by the type of teacher's solution (and
optionally also input specification) and can include specialization of
polymorphic functions and wrapping of inputs for higher order functions in such
a way they can be displayed and shrinked by QuickCheck.

For the simplest exercise functions (i.e. total functions operating on basic
Haskell data types like numbers, lists, tuples, and functions over these
types), our tool can generate tests just from the solution.
For more complex input data, it is necessary to either constrain inputs
(for example to positive numbers, or to a certain range), or to provide means
of generation of random inputs.
Input data generators for custom data types can be written using the QuickCheck
library.
Finally, to accommodate more complex exercises within the same framework, it is
also possible to write custom QuickCheck tests.

\section{Usage and Availability}

Our tool is open source and available on GitHub, at
\url{https://github.com/vlstill/hsExprTest}.
The documentation for testing Haskell can be found at
\url{https://github.com/vlstill/hsExprTest/tree/master/src/hs}.
The tool is used in the introductory course to functional programming at the
Faculty of Informatics of Masaryk University since 2014 and is continually
being improved.
While the tool is integrated with the Information System of Masaryk University
which is used to submit assignments and present results to students, it is
possible to also use it with a different submission frontends.

\section{Goal of the Poster}

The poster aims to present our novel testing method which simplifies testing of
small Haskell programming exercises.
We believe that by making testing easier, we can promote creation of more and
better exercises which students can use to improve their new skills.
The poster could also spark wider conversation about methods used in
programming courses.
