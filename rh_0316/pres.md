# The Current Situation

## DIVINE

*   explicit-state model checker for verification of parallel programs
    *   main focus on C++/\llvm
    *   also many other inputs: DVE, CESMI, timed automata
*   verifies safety and LTL properties
    *   specification depends on the input formalism
*   parallel (and distributed) verification
*   efficient state space reduction and compression techniques
*   <https://divine.fi.muni.cz>

## DIVINE: LLVM as an Input Language

*   used for verification of C and C++ programs
*   C and C++ library, C++ exceptions support
*   threads through `pthreads` or C++11
*   state space size reductions
*   safety properties: assertion safety, memory safety, uninitialized variables
    tracking, `pthreads` deadlock detection
*   LTL support

## My Work on DIVINE

*   compression of the state space
    *   reduces state space size for LLVM, roughly $100 - 500\times$ for
        reasonably sized programs (efficiency grows with program size)
    *   bachelor's thesis, published at SEFM 2015
*   export of explicit state space from DIVINE
    *   useful for chaining with other tools
    *   case study for probabilistic verification to appear on ACM SAC 2016
*   verification under more realistic memory models
    *   verification which is closer to behaviour or real-world memory
        hierarchies
    *   master's thesis, preliminary version at MEMICS 2015, extended version submitted for publication
*   extended and fixed state space reductions
    *   up to $3\times$ extra reduction
    *   master's thesis
*   code maintenance

## LLVM Transformations

*   LLVM IR can be easily transformed before the verification
*   can be used to extend model checker's abilities, reduce state space

*   case study: verification of weak memory models through LLVM transformation

## Weak Memory Models

*   in CPU a write performed by one thread need not be visible to other thread
    immediately
*   writes can be reordered -- with reads/also with stores
*   verifiers often omit this

. . .

Solution

*   the program is instrumented to simulate delayed writes
*   adds more nondeterminism to the program
*   LLVM transformation

# Plans

## Plans -- Overview

\begSaveBox{boxplans}

Long Term

*   improve practical usability of model checking for development of parallel
    programs
*   explore the usage of static analysis for pre-processing of programs for
    DIVINE

Short Term (this year)

*   more robust compilation of programs for DIVINE
*   register allocation for LLVM
*   verification of open programs using SMT (merge of SymDIVINE into DIVINE)

\endSaveBox

\usebox\boxplans

## Compilation of Programs for DIVINE

*   currently, DIVINE facilitates a simple wrapper over clang for compilation
    *   together with tweaked LLVM-based linker
*   DIVINE has to provide own implementation of C/C++/`thread`/… libraries
*   system configuration and even system headers can leak into DIVINE
    compilation now
*   hard to integrate into nontrivial build processes (makefiles, cmake,…)

. . .

Solution

*   an isolated environment which can access only user provided sources and
    DIVINE libraries
*   DIVINE compiler which can be used as a drop-in replacement for GCC/clang
*   ideally it would produce both LLVM bitcode for DIVINE and ELF binary
    *   allow build processes which feature code generating programs

## Register Allocation for LLVM

*   LLVM uses Static Single Assignment (registers not reused)
*   wastes memory in DIVINE
*   can prevent state merging (e.g. in optimized busy-waiting cycles)

. . .

Solution

*   allocate registers into slots, reuse slots
*   differs from register allocation in code generator of a compiler
    *   the number of registers is not fixed
    *   needs to consider program semantics

## Verification of Open Programs

*   programs with inputs cannot be fully verified by DIVINE
*   SymDIVINE can do this for simple programs
    -   a proof-of-concept tool for verification of open LLVM programs

Solution

*   the idea is to merge SymDIVINE into DIVINE using LLVM transformation
*   the program is to be changed so that is manipulates (parts of) data
    symbolically
*   this hybrid program is then executed by DIVINE which uses special algorithm
    to explore state space of such program
