## The Problem Introduction

*   we are concerned with helping developers create correct programs

    . . .

*   using formal methods

    . . .

*   these methods have to be actually usable

    *   minimal investment from the developers perspective
    *   gives useful answers most of the time

## Ways Towards Program Correctness

**many already widely used methods**

*   testing
    *   unit tests, integration tests, scenarios,…

        . . .

    *   well used by developers
    *   cannot proof absence of errors
    *   does not work well with nondeterministic programs

        . . .

        *   threading

            . . .

        *   nondeterministic error injection

        . . .

    *   requires good tests

    . . .

*   static analysis

    *   good for finding common problems directly from the source (without
        execution)

    *   compiler warnings, linters, …

## Ways Towards Program Correctness

**formal methods**

*   symbolic execution

    *   often used for test case generation to increase coverage
    *   requires program which terminate for all inputs to work well
    *   mostly used for sequential programs with arbitrary input data
    *   detects violations of given property, strength depends on the property
    *   path explosion

     . . .

*   \redon{4}{explicit-state model checking}

    *   mostly used for parallel or otherwise nondeterministic programs
        without nondeterministic input data
    *   can deal with non-terminating programs as long as they have finitely
        many states
    *   detects violations of given property, strength depends on the property
    *   state-space explosion

    . . .

*   theorem proving

    *   requires substantial human input
    *   the user must be skilled both in programming and in mathematical
        reasoning

## Introducing Explicit-State Model Checking

*   verifies given property by systematically exploring all possible runs of the
    program

    . . .

    *   or a sufficient subset of runs needed to prove the property holds

    . . .

*   does this by exploring all possible states in which the program can be and
    creating *state space graph*

. . .

\center
\begin{tikzpicture}[>=stealth',shorten >=1pt,auto,node distance=3em,initial text=, ->]
    \tikzstyle{every state} = [ellipse, minimum size = 1.5em]
    \path[use as bounding box] (-5.2,0.3) rectangle (5.2,-3.2);

    \node[state] (init) {\texttt{x = 0; y = 0}};
    \node<5->[state, below left = of init] (l) {\texttt{x = 1; y = 0}};
    \node<6->[state, below right = of init] (r) {\texttt{x = 0; y = 1}};
    \node<7->[state, below right = of l] (c) {\texttt{x = 1; y = 1}};

    \path<5-> (init) edge node[above left] {\texttt{x := 1}} (l);
    \path<6-> (init) edge node {\texttt{y := 1}} (r);
    \path<7-> (l) edge node[below left] {\texttt{y := 1}} (c);
    \path<8-> (r) edge node {\texttt{x := 1}} (c);
\end{tikzpicture}

## Introducing DIVINE

*   an explicit-state model checker
*   a platform for verification of software written in C and C++

    . . .

*   aims to be useful for developers
    *   testing nondeterministic programs
    *   strict memory checking
    *   support for complex properties, including temporal properties of
        infinite runs

    . . .

*   has to solve many problems to be usable
    *   comprehension of the input language and its common libraries

        . . .

    *   efficient storage of program state

        . . .

    *   efficient exploration of important parts of the state space

        . . .

    *   general usability without expertise in program analysis

## Language Support in DIVINE

*   DIVINE executes LLVM intermediate language (LLVM IR)
*   C and C++ can be translated to LLVM IR using clang compiler

    . . .

*   all parts of the program, including the libraries it uses, need to be
    translated to LLVM IR

    *   DIVINE handles the translation of user's program and links it to
        pre-translated libraries
    *   C and C++ standard libraries + `pthreads` are supported

## State Space Storage

\begin{minipage}{0.6\textwidth}

*   DIVINE needs to store the state space

*   states are essential snapshots of the memory of the program
    *   memory is organised as a graph

. . .

\footnotesize

```{.cpp}
template< typename T >
struct Node {
    Node(T val, Node *n = nullptr) :
        val(val), next(n) 
    {}
    Node *next = nullptr;
    T val;
};
int main() {
    Node<int> *n1 = new Node<int>(1);
    Node<int> *n2 = new Node<int>(2, n1);
}
```

\end{minipage}\hfill\begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
![heap](test.pdf)
\end{minipage}

## Efficiency of State Space Storage

*   currently blocks of memory are stored deduplicated
*   but minor change in a large block requires it to be stored whole again

    . . .

*   there are compression methods available, the interesting part is using
    them in both memory and time efficient way

. . .

*   there is also possibility of optimizing the program in a way the state
    representation is smaller

    *   detecting unchanging global variables
    *   slicing-out provably unused variables
    *   breaking static single assignment form of LLVM
    *   …

## Efficient Exploration of State Space

*   in the case of parallelism, we need to explore all the different
    interleavings to detect errors caused by data races

. . .

*   not all interleavings are visibly different
    *   not all actions of a thread are visible to other threads
    *   local actions can stay hidden

        . . .

    *   the interesting part is detecting *local actions*

. . .

*   local actions can be anything
    *   that does not interact which memory

        . . .

    *   that does not interact with *globally visible* memory

        . . .

    *   that interacts with globally visible memory *that is nevertheless only
        accessed by one thread*

## Efficient Exploration of State Space II

*   even with hiding of local actions, DIVINE explores state space eagerly
    *   many interleaving can have same results because threads do not actually
        interact

    . . .

*   it should be possible to combine *(dynamic) partial order reduction*
    techniques with DIVINE

    *   these techniques allow exploration of only a subset of state's
        successors if this subset is sufficient

## Integration With Static Analysis and Optimizations

*   in some cases it is better to aid reduction by static analysis and
    optimizations then calculate everything at runtime

    *   can save work at runtime

        . . .

    *   if interprocedural analysis is needed

        . . .

    *   if it is necessary to reorder or replace instructions

        . . .

    *   to simplify the executor

. . .

*   any optimizations done by DIVINE have to be safe -- must not change
    verification outcome

    . . .

    *   compiler optimizations are safe only for sequential programs
    *   we need optimizations safe for all programs
