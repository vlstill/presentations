## LART

LLVM Abstraction and Refinement Tool

*   cannot do any abstraction or refinement (yet)

. . .

*   generic platform for LLVM-to-LLVM transformations
*   uses LLVM's C++ API to run transformation and optimization passes

. . .

*   currently implements:
    *   transformations for SV-COMP
    *   weak memory models transformation (from MEMICS 2015)
    *   several simple parallel-safe optimizations

# SV-COMP

## SV-COMP, Concurrency Category

DIVINE is an explicit state model checker

*   not really well suited for SV-COMP
*   no smart handling of nondeterminism
    *   explicit enumeration of nondeterministic choice
*   exhaustive search of relevant interleavings
    *   but it uses smart reduction techniques to eliminate many
        uninteresting interleavings

. . .

in concurrency category of SV-COMP:

*   little or no nondeterminism
*   most programs are reasonably small
*   DIVINE is quite fast and memory efficient!

## How to Verify SV-COMP Models with DIVINE?

**bold** = LART LLVM transformation

1.  compile model with `clang` using `divine compile`
    *   this compiles the model and C library functions, `pthreads`,…

. . .

2.  **add atomic sections to atomic functions**
    *   translation from SV-COMP atomic functions to DIVINE's equivalent
    *   add atomic masks to atomic functions

. . .

3.  **change all reads and writes of globals to be volatile**
    *   SV-COMP models often have undefined behavior

. . .

4.  run LLVM `opt` to optimize resulting LLVM bitcode (`-Oz`)

## How to Verify SV-COMP Models with DIVINE?

5.  **try to eliminate or constrain nondeterministic choices**
    *   bools are OK
    *   nondeterministic pointers can be either `NULL` or `1` (which is also not
        a valid pointer)
        *   we found no models in SV-COMP concurrency category where this causes bad answer
    *   for other types try to constrain the choice
        *   two common patterns recognised: cast to `bool` and modulo constant value
        *   more precise tracking could be done by bounded symbolic execution

. . .

6.  **disable `malloc` failure**
    *   in DIVINE every call to `malloc` can return `NULL` (nondeterminism)
    *   SV-COMP, however, works in idealized world where there is infinite
        amound of memory…

## How to Verify SV-COMP Models with DIVINE?

7.  run DIVINE, check only for assertions
    *   there are often other problems
        *   calls with wrong number of parameters
        *   missing return statements ($\rightarrow$ undefined value)
    *   use state space compression

. . .

**Results**

We expect to get more then $900$ points in concurrency.

*   time is the limiting factor

# Weak Memory Models

## Weak Memory Models

*   the order of reads and writes in the code does not need to match the order of their execution
    *   compiler optimizations
    *   out-of-order execution, cache hierarchy

. . .

*   it is hard to reason about memory models
*   parallelism is hard even under **Sequential Consistency**
    *   reads and writes are immediate and cannot be reordered
    *   not realistic, expensive to enforce

. . .

*   newer revisions of C/C++ have support for specifying atomic variables with
    memory access ordering
    *   same for Java, LLVM bitcode,…

. . .

*   verifiers often assume sequential consistency
    *   so does DIVINE

## Total Store Order

*   similar to the memory model used by x86_64
*   the order of execution of stores is guaranteed to match their order in
    machine code
    *   compiler might still reorder stores
*   independent loads can be reordered

## Weak Memory Models {.fragile}

\begin{latex}
\begin{lstlisting}[belowskip=0pt]
int x = 0, y = 0;
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.45\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=left,aboveskip=0pt]
void thread0() {
    y = 1;
    cout << "x = " << x;
  }
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}%
\hfill%
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.45\textwidth}

void thread1() {
    x = 1;
    cout << "y = " << y;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\end{latex} \pause

**Total Store Order can be simulated using store buffers:**

## TSO Under-approximation in DIVINE

*   we use bounded store buffer to under-approximate TSO

*   TSO simulation is implemented as an LLVM-to-LLVM transformation
    *   no need to change DIVINE to use weak memory models
    *   no need to change verified source code
    *   store buffer size can be configured in the transformation

## The Transformation to TSO

*   every `load`, `store` and memory intrinsic[^mi] is replaced by function
    which simulates TSO

*   for each thread of the original program, a thread which flushes its store
    buffer is added

*   for an atomic instruction, the store buffer is first flushed and then the
    instruction is executed without modification

[^mi]: `llvm.memcpy`, `llvm.memmove`, `llvm.memset`

## Improvements over the MEMICS Version

*   store buffer can be bypassed for load of thread-local memory location
    *   the thread-locality is recognized dynamically by DIVINE

*   manipulations with local variables whose address is never taken are not
    transformed
    *   saves runtime check and entering atomic section (which can cause state
        to be produced)

*   memory safety can be verified
    *   entries for memory location which cease to exist are evicted from store
        buffer

## Memory Safety with TSO

problem: store buffer can be flushed after memory becomes invalid

*   flush of value of local variable after function exists
    *   \text{\only<2>\bf remove entry from store buffer before function exit}
*   flush of value of dynamic memory after `free`
    *   remove entry from store buffer in `free`

## Local Variable Cleanup

**remove entry from store buffer before function exit**

*   easy for C, just add cleanup before `return`

. . .

*   much harder in C++: **exceptions**
    *   function can be exited due to exception propagation
    *   cleanups are similar to C++ destructors
    *   need to stop the excetpion propagation, do cleanup, resume exception


## Improvements over the MEMICS Version

number of states for various models with TSO transformation

\begin{tabular}{l|llll} \hline
Model                & MEMICS  & $+$ load private       & $+$ local             & SC \\ \hline
\texttt{fifo-1}      & $44$ M  & $5.6$ M ($7.9\times$)  & $1.2$ M ($4.6\times$) & $7$ K \\
\texttt{fifo-2}      & $338$ M & $51$ M ($6.6\times$)   & $11$ M ($4.6\times$)  & $7$ K \\
\texttt{fifo-3}      & $672$ M & $51$ M ($13\times$)    & $11$ M ($4.6\times$)  & $7$ K \\
\texttt{simple-1}    & $538$ K & $19$ K ($28\times$)    & $11$ K ($1.7\times$)  & 251 \\
\texttt{peterson-2}  & $103$ K & $40$ K ($2.6\times$)   & $24$ K ($1.6\times$)  & $1.4$ K \\
\texttt{pt\_mutex-2} & $1.6$ M & $12$ K ($135\times$)   & $7.5$ K ($1.6\times$) & 98 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

*   load private = loads to memory not visible by other thread bypass store
    buffer
*   local = manipulations with locals to which address is never taken are not
    transformed

# Parallel Safe Optimizations

## Parallel Safe Optimizations -- Motivation

```{.cpp}
int x = 0;
void *foo( void *_ ) {
    x = 1;
    assert( x == 1 );
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t thread;
    pthread_create( &thread, NULL, &foo, NULL );
    x = 2;
    pthread_join( thread, NULL );
}
```

Can the assertion be triggered?

## Parallel Safe Optimizations -- Motivation

LLVM s `-O0`:

```{.llvm}
define i8* @foo(i8* %_) {
entry:
  %_.addr = alloca i8*
  store i8* %_, i8** %_.addr
  store i32 1, i32* @x
  %0 = load i32, i32* @x
  %tobool = icmp ne i32 %0, 0
  %conv = zext i1 %tobool to i32
  %cmp = icmp eq i32 %conv, 1
  %conv1 = zext i1 %cmp to i32
  call void @__divine_assert(i32 %conv1)
  ret i8* null
}
```

## Parallel Safe Optimizations -- Motivation

LLVM s `-O2`:

```{.llvm}
define noalias i8* @foo(i8* %_) {
entry:
  store i32 1, i32* @x
  tail call void @__divine_assert(i32 1)
  ret i8* null
}
```

. . .

*   optimization changed behavior of the program
*   `x` is not set to be `volatile`, or atomic!

## Parallel Safe Optimizations

standard compiler optimizations do not preserve parallel behavior of the
program

*   also do not preserve readability of debugging information
*   variables promotion, function inlining, code movement, cycle invariant
    code motion

## Parallel Safe Optimizations

optimizations can increase state space size

*   often by adding registers

    *   loops
    ```cpp
    while (x != 0) { /* ... */ }
    ```
    can get transformed into
    ```cpp
    if (x != 0) { do { /* ... */ } while (x != 0); }
    ```

    *   inlining
    *   variable promotion

*   states which used to be same are now distinguishable

## Parallel Safe Optimizations

*   it is desirable to verify code with the optimizations intended by user of
    verification tool
    *   both for usability of results and readability of counterexamples

*   but some optimizations can help verifier to run faster, with less memory

## Parallel Safe Optimizations

*   design optimizations which cannot change verified properties
    *   safety, stutter-invariant LTL
*   can tightly cooperate with DIVINE

## Example of Parallel Safe Optimization

**Constant Alloca Elimintation**

*   local variables in LLVM -- results of `alloca` instruction
    *   memory for a variable is allocated (on stack) so that it can be passed by
        referrence
    *   often the variable is neither modified nor accessed through pointer

*   if variable is constant and does not escape the functions it can be
    eliminated
    *   use of any load from `alloca` is replaced by value which was originally
        stored into it

*   compared to LLVM's register promotion this does not add registers

## Future

**Atomic Cycles**

*   if a cycle can be proven to terminate and not perform any visible action it
    can be executed inside atomic section
*   without the atomic section DIVINE emits state after each iteration
*   static or dynamic detection of visibility

*   need to employ termination detection

## Future

**Silent loads/stores**

*   DIVINE's notion of `load`/`store` visibility is based on pointer tracking
*   a value might be reachable by pointers from more then one thread, but might
    be accessed only by one
*   mark `load`/`store` as silent to avoid visibility checking
*   could also improve verification speed
*   requires good pointer analysis

**Slicing**

*   hard to preserve all properties (memory safety,…)
*   maybe as an approximation

## Future

**Symbolic Data**

*   DIVINE and SymDIVINE will be merged
*   symbolic data manipulation compiled in LLVM
*   state comparison using SMT in DIVINE

*   again, we will need good pointer analysis for parallel code
